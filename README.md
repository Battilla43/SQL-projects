These SQL project were done in class. The first two projects we were given datasets and a list of queries we had to create. 

Project 3 was an assignment using Java. In this assignment we were tasked to create a Library databae for the user. This alloed him to find different items based on the queries. 

Project 4 was to create a schema ourself.
